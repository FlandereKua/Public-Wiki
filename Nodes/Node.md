# Node-Based Power System

## Overview

This document describes the Node-Based Power System, a framework for categorizing abilities, knowledge, and traits in a structured, objective manner. Nodes and Links are defined by their properties, acquisition methods, and enhancement options.

## Character Tier

A character's Tier is determined by the highest Tier of any Node they possess. Tier is a measure of capability and influence, not a direct indicator of overall strength.

## Node Definition

Nodes are discrete units representing abilities, knowledge, or traits. Types include:
- **Active Skills**: Executable abilities (e.g., spells, maneuvers)
- **Passive Abilities**: Persistent effects (e.g., stat bonuses)
- **Knowledge**: Information (e.g., recipes, lore)
- **Titles & Reputations**: Social standing
- **Mutations**: Permanent alterations

Nodes may have beneficial, neutral, or detrimental effects.

## Node Tiers

Node Tiers indicate rarity, power, and acquisition difficulty. Tiers are assigned numerically and descriptively.

### Standard Tiers

| Tier       | Number | Description                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common     | 1      | Foundational abilities and knowledge. Easily accessible and widely distributed.          |
| Uncommon   | 2      | Specialized skills, moderately accessible. May require focused effort or training.       |
| Rare       | 3      | Defining abilities, requiring significant effort, discovery, or achievement.             |
| Renowned   | 4      | Abilities that confer local recognition. Often tied to notable accomplishments.          |
| Heroic     | 5      | Abilities capable of influencing regional events. Typically associated with major feats. |
| Epic       | 6      | Powers with kingdom-level impact. Frequently the subject of stories and legends.         |
| Legendary  | 7      | Abilities comparable to historical heroes. Rare and transformative.                      |
| Immortal   | 8      | Powers that interact with fundamental forces, granting longevity or godlike traits.      |
| Ascendance | 9      | The highest mortal achievement, merging personal identity with abstract concepts.        |

#### Expanded Tier Details
- **Common (1):** Entry-level abilities, basic knowledge, or minor traits. Acquisition is straightforward.
- **Uncommon (2):** Skills or knowledge requiring some specialization. Accessible through focused learning or minor achievements.
- **Rare (3):** Abilities that define a character's path. Often require overcoming significant challenges or unique discoveries.
- **Renowned (4):** Powers that bring recognition within a community or region. Linked to notable deeds or mastery.
- **Heroic (5):** Abilities that can alter the course of events in a region. Typically earned through major quests or legendary acts.
- **Epic (6):** Powers with far-reaching consequences, affecting nations or kingdoms. Acquisition is rare and often story-driven.
- **Legendary (7):** Abilities that place a character among the greatest figures in history. Usually tied to world-altering events.
- **Immortal (8):** Powers that transcend mortality, interacting with primal forces or granting immortality. Acquisition may involve divine or cosmic intervention.
- **Ascendance (9):** The ultimate form of power, blurring the line between individual and concept. Represents the peak of achievement.

#### Special Tiers
- **Mythical/Godly (Negative Numbers):** Nodes representing divine or primordial power. Acquisition may involve direct interaction with deities or fundamental forces. Not inherently superior to Ascendance, but operate on different principles.
- **Outer/Complex (Complex Numbers):** Nodes with reality-warping effects, often unpredictable and paradoxical. May introduce drawbacks or unconventional abilities.

## Links and Linking

### Linking
Linking is the process of acquiring a new Node. Prerequisite Nodes are required for logical progression (e.g., Basic Swordsmanship before Advanced Swordsmanship).

### Links
Links connect Nodes. Types include:
- **Standard Link:** Prerequisite connection
- **Enhanced Link:** Grants bonuses when both Nodes are active
- **Tether Link:** Connects distant Nodes, requiring rare resources or story events

## Node Acquisition

Nodes are unlocked through various methods:
- Combat (defeating foes)
- Research (studying or reverse-engineering)
- Activities (crafting, tournaments, exploration)
- Dialogue & Exchange (learning from others, trading)
- Discovery (finding hidden locations or events)

## Enhancement

Nodes and Links can be enhanced:
- **Node Enhancement:** Modify effects, tune attributes
- **Link Enhancement:** Add synergy bonuses, change activation order, create Tether Links

## Unique Nodes and Links

Unique Nodes/Links are exclusive to one character at a time. Acquisition is tied to singular events. Transfer occurs upon the character's death or loss of the Node.

This system is designed to encourage diverse character development and objective progression through structured choices and achievements.
