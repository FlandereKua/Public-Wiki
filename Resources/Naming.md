#### **Tier 2: Martial Prowess**
- **Description:** The user has moved beyond simple swinging and now puts intention and force behind their strike. The focus is on physical mastery and creating a more impactful blow. The technique is still purely martial.
- **Example Names:**
    - **Crescent Cleave:** A wide, arcing slash designed to strike multiple foes in front of the user.
    - **Rending Strike:** A focused, tearing slash that aims to bypass armor and leave a bleeding wound.
    - **Impact Edge:** A heavy, powerful blow that uses the wielder's entire body, capable of staggering an opponent.
#### **Tier 3: The Flow of Qi (Eastern Theme Begins)**
- **Description:** The swordsman learns to channel their inner energy, or Qi, into the blade. The slash is no longer just a piece of moving steel; it is an extension of their life force. The blade glows with a faint aura, and the strikes become unnaturally fast and fluid.
- **Example Names:**
    - **Flowing Blade Style:** A graceful, continuous slash that seems to have no beginning or end, allowing for rapid, successive strikes.
    - **Wind-Shearing Cut:** By infusing the blade with swift Qi, the slash becomes fast enough to cut the air itself, increasing its speed and range slightly.
    - **Jade Serpent's Bite:** A precise, lightning-fast thrusting slash imbued with piercing Qi, designed to find and exploit weaknesses in a foe's defense.
#### **Tier 4: Projecting Intent**
- **Description:** Mastery over Qi has deepened. The swordsman no longer needs the blade to make contact; they can now project their energy outwards in a visible wave of force. This is the birth of the "sword beam" or "blade qi." The slash can now strike from a distance.
- **Example Names:**
    - **Azure Dragon's Wake:** The slash releases a visible, crescent-shaped wave of azure energy that travels forward, cutting through multiple enemies in its path.
    - **Mountain-Parting Intent:** A powerful, focused slash that projects a straight line of immense force. It doesn't just cut; it shatters, excelling at breaking through shields and solid defenses.
    - **Heart-Echoing Blade:** A more esoteric technique where the projected Qi is imbued with the user's spirit. It strikes not just the body, but the target's own energy flow, briefly disrupting their skills.
#### **Tier 5: Transcending Form**
- **Description:** The user is on the cusp of enlightenment. The distinction between the sword, their Qi, and their will begins to blur. The slash becomes a concept more than a technique, bending the rules of the physical world. These are legendary, near-mythical techniques.
- **Example Names:**
    - **Myriad Forms as One:** The swordsman executes a slash that momentarily creates countless phantasmal after-images of the blade, striking the target from all angles at once. A single swing manifests as a thousand cuts.
    - **Star-Shattering Sword Soul:** By pouring their very soul into the attack, the blade becomes metaphysically sharp. This slash can damage ethereal beings, ignore physical armor, and cut through magical barriers as if they were paper.
    - **Dominion of the Celestial Edge:** A slash that cuts space itself. The user can strike a location a short distance away instantly, bypassing the intervening distance and any obstacles. The attack appears out of thin air on top of the enemy.
