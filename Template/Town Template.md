# {{Town Name}} (Town)

How to use
- Tierless template. Do not write numeric tiers in names. Use role/difficulty scaling below.
- Keep node names in [Square Case] and include Acquisition/Mitigation where relevant.
- Towns differ: attractions are not fixed. A town may have no tavern/inn, or replace it with a shrine, bathhouse, bunkhouse, waystation, etc.

---

## Overview
A 3–5 sentence summary of the town’s purpose, mood, economy, and what makes it distinct.

- Adjacency: Nearby zones/routes (e.g., forest trail, arterial road, river landing).
- Specialization: What the town is known for (lumber, ore, trade, healing, faith, etc.).
- Safety: General danger level and who maintains order.

---

## Key Locations & Attractions
Provide 3–6 locations. Each location should have Services and Notable Nodes with Acquisition.

## Integration Notes (Designer)
- Role-based scaling:
  - Town difficulty anchors local node power: common/service nodes ≈ local − 2; specialty nodes ≈ local − 1; titles/keystones ≈ local.
  - Detriments baseline ≈ local − 2 to − 1; escalate during events or rule breaches.
- Ensure each Notable Node has a clear in-world Acquisition.
- Detriments should have at least one local Mitigation route.
- Tie 1+ quests to each key location where possible.
- Place 2–4 NPCs with social links across locations.
