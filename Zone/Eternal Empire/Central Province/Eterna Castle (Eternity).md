# Eterna Castle (Eternity) (Tier 8) (Enemy Zone)

---

## Overview
With Elizabeth von Eterna's ascension, the Throne of Dawn has been transformed. No longer a place of political intrigue, Eterna Castle is now a pure fortress under martial law, its grandeur replaced by an oppressive, militaristic atmosphere. The castle's magitech defenses are on high alert, and its halls are patrolled by the Empress's handpicked elite. To reach the throne is to challenge the very heart of the Empire's consolidated power.

- **Biome**: Urban Fortress / Magitech Dungeon
- **Hooks**: Confronting the new Empress, challenging her two most powerful retainers.
- **Navigation**: All areas are hostile. The path to the throne is a linear gauntlet through heavily fortified positions. There are no safe zones.
