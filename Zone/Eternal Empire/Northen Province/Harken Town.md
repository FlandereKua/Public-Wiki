# Harken Town (Town)

---

## Overview
Harken Town is a small, remote logging settlement nestled in the foothills of the Eternal Empire's Northern Province. Its purpose is to supply timber to the Empire's grand airship projects, but its distance from the capital keeps it quiet and insulated from major political affairs. The mood is generally peaceful, with hardworking and friendly folk who are welcoming to strangers but wary of outsiders meddling in their affairs.

- **Adjacency**: Arken Forest, Imperial road to a larger provincial hub.
- **Specialization**: Lumber, Hunting.
- **Safety**: Generally safe. The town is protected by a small, volunteer-based local watch. The primary dangers come from wildlife in the surrounding forest.
